THOSE NUMBERS WHICH SUM OF THE CUBE OF ITS DIGITS IS EQUAL TO THAT NUMBER ARE KNOWN AS ARMSTRONG NUMBERS. 
FOR EXAMPLE 153 SINCE 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1+ 125 + 9 =153

OTHER ARMSTRONG NUMBERS: 370,371,407 ETC.


code snippet
temp=num;
    while(num!=0){
         r=num%10;
         num=num/10;
         sum=sum+(r*r*r);
